**Key Features:**

- **SQL-style file selection**: `SELECT "script.py" FROM ~/projects/` to load files into state
- **Stateful file management**: Single-file state system for focused workflow
- **Quick favorites system**: Save frequently used files and executables for instant access
- **Global file search**: Find exact file locations system-wide with `FINDEXACT`
- **Direct execution**: Run selected files or favorites with simple commands

**New Features!**
- **List-based Autocomplete:** Get auto-complete recommendations on Directory/File names as you type!
- **Native Shell Support:** Access your native shell (Powershell or CMD) within dir2 with a simple command `CML`.
- **Directory/File Manip Commands**: Perform Create/Rename/Delete operations on Directories or Files without leaving dir2.

Transform your command-line file management from traditional navigation to intuitive querying. Perfect for developers who think in SQL and want a more declarative approach to file system operations.

Uses the `rust_search` module for system-wide search integration for Windows.

## Building the Project

**Prerequisites:**

- Rust toolchain installed (visit [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/) for installation)
- Windows 10/11 operating system
- Git (for cloning the repository)

**Build Steps:**

1. **Clone the repository:**

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd directory_2
```

Build the project:

```bash
cargo build --release
```

Run the application:

```bash
cargo run --release
```

Install globally (optional):

```bash
cargo install --path .
```

This installs dir2 to your Cargo bin directory, making it available system-wide.

**Development Build**: For development and testing, you can use the debug build which compiles faster:

```bash
cargo build
cargo run
```

**Dependencies**: All required dependencies, including the rust_search module, will be automatically downloaded and compiled by Cargo during the build process.

**Example Usage:**
